{"name":"Wbtc-2015","tagline":"","body":"### WBTC exercise one\r\n\r\nThis exercise was written in the modul Web Technology at Bern University of Applied Science.\r\n\r\nThe first task was to design IRI patterns for my own web profile. \r\nAfterwards I had to describe why I had chosen them. The last task was to explain in a short summary  \r\nto a five year old kid what \"Linked Data\" is.\r\n\r\n### My IRI patterns:\r\n\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/#me\r\n*  http://mailto:dena.sargent@bluewin.ch\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/education\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/education/university\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/education/university/bachelor\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/education/university/bachelor/Business IT\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/experiences/Swisscom\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/interests\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/interests/sports\r\n*  http://dena.sargent.ch/interests/sports/crossfit\r\n\r\n\r\nI have chosen these URI's because I think my name or education an experiences will not change & will be true after a 100 years. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Linked Data (what it is & Why it is important)\r\n\r\nWell everybody has a favourite dish. Let’s say you’re favourite food is Lasagne and you have a special recipe for cooking it.The recipe is a list of information which shows the typical ingredients you need with the exact amount and the preparation time that is required.\r\nUnfortunately you aren’t the only human on earth, so you can imagine that there are other people in Switzerland \r\nor in other countries that have the Lasagne as favourite dish. \r\nAnd it is not unusual that every single person has their one special recipe for preparing it. \r\nSo at the moment everybody has their one recipe Information to themselves, but what if you would like to try a new variation of the Lasagne. \r\nMaybe you know somebody who has a good recipe, so what do you do? You will ask him for the recipe information.\r\nBut what about the other people from different countries? You can’t just walk to Rom and ask Pedro about \r\nthe recipe information.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s where Linked data comes in handy.\r\nIn the World Wide Web you have a huge amount of Information from different kind of people from different countries.\r\nEvery single person has their one website with the recipe information. What linked data does is to connect the Information \r\nfrom a website to another website.\r\nSo that means that websites with the same subject, like a lasagne recipe, can be linked to one another. \r\nLinked data is very important for searching machines such as Google. \r\nBecause when you search the word \"Lasagne\" the searching machine can show you a bunch of websites all related to the subject. Without linked data you wouldn’t have a list of options.\r\n\r\n### Reference \r\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?=4x_xzT5eF5Q\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
